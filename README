Beta testers wanted for Text::Reflow, a Perl module for reflowing
paragraphs of text using Knuth's paragraphing algorithm.
The program looks for "optimal" places to insert line breaks in
order to avoid breaking up phrases.  This results in more ragged,
but more readable paragraphs.  Email Martin.Ward@durham.ac.uk
for more information, or look at http://i.am/mw/martin/software/
